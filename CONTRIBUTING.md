# 🤝 Contributing Guide

Thanks for helping keep this list up to date! 
You can contribute **with or without coding**.

---

## 🚀 Easiest way (recommended): Use the Issue Form

**No fork. No Markdown. No PR writing.**

1. Go to **Issues**
2. Click **New issue**
3. Select **Add internship**
4. Fill the form and submit

🤖 A bot will automatically:
- add the internship to the table
- open a Pull Request
- link it back to your issue

You just review the PR and confirm it looks correct.

## 🧾 What to Add

Please only submit:
- **Internship or co-op roles**
- **Based in Canada** (or remote roles open to Canadians)
- **Winter / Summer / Fall 2026**
- Tech roles: **Software, Data, Product, QA, DevOps, AI, ML**, etc.
- From **verified sources** (company site, LinkedIn, Workday, Greenhouse, Lever, etc.)

## 📄 Manual contribution (optional)

If you prefer opening a PR yourself, add a row to the table in `README.md` using this format:

| Company | Role | Location | Apply | Date Posted |
|--------|------|----------|:-----:|-------------|
| Shopify | Software Developer Intern | Remote, Canada | [![Apply](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Apply-blue?style=for-the-badge)](https://www.shopify.com/careers) | Jul 01 |

**Guidelines:**
- Keep locations short (`Toronto, ON`, `Remote`)
- Use the blue **Apply** button format
- Use the original job posting date
- New rows are added at the **end of the table** to avoid reordering

---

## ⚠️ Please Don’t

- Add full-time or freelance roles
- Add non-Canadian positions
- Add expired or unverified listings
- Reorder or reformat existing rows

---

## 🙌 Thank You

Every contribution helps thousands of students.  
Whether it’s one role or many, it matters.
